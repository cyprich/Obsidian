# Tmux
[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a terminal thingy which let's you keep your sessions, manage windows and whatsoever :)  
I'm learning from [Youtube tutorial by *Dreams of Code*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzNmUNvnB04)  
I'm not going into configuration and stuff because I already have this config done in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/cyprich/dotfiles.git) 

# Install
You will need to install `tmux` package with your package manager  
Configuration can be downloaded from [my dotfiles](https://github.com/cyprich/dotfiles.git) 
Run it simply with `tmux` command  

# Basic terms
Tmux consists of 3 main objects:
- Sessions
	- The main, topmost layer of Tmux
	- You can have any number of Sessions open up, but typically only attach to one
	- It contains one or more Windows, one of which is active
- Windows
	- Windows are inside Sessions
	- Similar to tabs in web browser
	- Only one can be active *(marked with `*`)*
	- Consists of one or more Panes
	- Info about Windows is show at the bottom of the screen
- Panes

You have Session, which can be split into Windows, which can be split into Panes  

# Commands/shortcuts/keybinds

> Note: As said before, you have to hit `<prefix>` before any of these commands... I just didn't wrote it here because it'll be too long

# Sessions
Tmux sessions can be created by using the `tmux` command whilst not attached to another Tmux session  
You can make names session with this command `tmux new -s name_of_the_session`  

List Tmux session   
```bash
tmux ls  # ouside session
<prefix> s  # inside session
<prefix> w  # inside session + preview
```

Attach to session  
```bash
tmux attach  # most recent session
tmux attach -t name_of_the_session  # specific session
```
