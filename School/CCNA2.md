- ~~Floating static route~~

What is the correct syntax of a floating static route? 
- ~~`ip route 209.165.200.228 255.255.255.248 serial 0/0/0`~~
- `ip route 209.165.200.228 255.255.255.248 10.0.0.1 120`
- ~~`ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 serial 0/0/0`~~
- ~~`ip route 172.16.0.0 255.248.0.0 10.0.0.1`~~

Which static route statement shows a recursive IPv6 static route?
- ~~`ipv6 route 0::/0 s0/0/0`~~
- ~~`ipv6 route 0::/0 s0/0/0 254`~~
- ~~`ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/56 s0/0/0`~~
- `ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/56 2001:db8:1000:10::1`
- ~~`ipv6 route 2001:db8:cafe:1::/56 s0/0/0 2001:db8:1000:10::1`~~

A network administrator is configuring a route to forward packets to a specific web server. What type of route should be configured by the administrator? 
- A host route
- ~~An OSPF route~~
- ~~An EIGRP route~~
- ~~A default route~~
- ~~A static route with an administrative distance higher than 1~~

Which command would create a valid IPv6 default route?
- ~~`ipv6 route ::/0 fe80::1`~~
- ~~`ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/64 ::1`~~
- `ipv6 route ::/0 2001:db8:acad:2::a`
- ~~`ipv6 route ::/128 2001:db8:acad:1::1`~~

What is a characteristic of a default static route? 
- ~~It backs up a route already discovered by a dynamic routing protocol~~
- ~~It uses a single network address to send multiple static routes to one destination address~~
- It identifies the gateway IP address to which the router sends all IP packets for which it does not have a learned or static route
- ~~It is configured with a higher administrative distance than is the original dynamic routing protocol~~

What is the purpose of a floating static route?
- ~~It allows summarization of contiguous networks~~
- It allows an alternate connection to be used when the preferred link fails
- ~~It is commonly used when a dynamic routing protocol is not being used ~~
- ~~It allows connectivity to remote destination that are not contained in the routing table~~

Which IPv6 static route would serve as a backup route to a dynamic route learned through OSPF?
- ~~`Router(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/32 2001:db8:acad:6::2 100`~~
- ~~`Router(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/32 2001:db8:acad:6::100`~~
- `Router(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/32 2001:db8:acad:6::2 200`
- ~~`Router(config)# ipv6 route 2001:db8:acad:1::/32 g0/0 2001:db8:acad:6::100 100`~~

What command, or set of commands, would be used to determine if the following configuration on router HQ works as designed?  
```
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0/0 10
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/1/0
```
- `HQ(config)# interface s0/1/0`<br/>`HQ(config-if)# shutdown`<br/>`HQ(config-if)# end`<br/>`HQ# show ip route`
- ~~`HQ# traceroute 128.107.0.99`~~
- ~~`HQ# show ip interface brief`~~
- ~~`HQ# ping 128.107.0.99`<br/>`traceroute 64.100.0.5`~~
- ~~`HQ# show ip route`~~

Which type of static route typically uses the `distance` parameter in the `ip route` global configuration command?
- ~~Summary static route~~
- ~~Default static route~~
- Floating static route
- ~~Standard static route~~

Why would a floating static route be configured with an administrative distance that is higher than the administrative distance of a dynamic routing protocol that is running on the same router?
- To be used as a backup route
- ~~To load-balance the traffic~~
- ~~To act as a gateway of last resort~~
- ~~To be the priority route in the routing table~~

What network address and subnet mask combination would be used to create a default static route that matches any IPv4 destination?
- `0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0`
- ~~`0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255`~~
- ~~`255.255.255.255 255.255.255.255`~~
- ~~`255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0`~~

# Module 16: Troubleshoot Static and Default Routes
## 16.1. Packet Processing with Static Routes
Refer to the exhibit  
![](../images/ccna2_routes1.png) 

True of False? R1 must encapsulate received packets into new frames before forwarding them to R2
- True 
- ~~False~~

True or False? R2 will forward frames to R3 with an all 1s Layer 2 address
- True
- ~~False~~

What action will R3 take to forward a frame if it does not have an entry in the ARP table to resolve a destination MAC address?
- ~~Sends a DNS request~~
- ~~Drops the frame~~
- Sends an ARP request
- ~~Sends frame to the default gateway~~

## 16.3. Module Practice and Quiz

A network administrator has entered a static route to an Ethernet LAN that is connected to an adjacent router. However, the route is not shown in the routing table. Which command would the administrator use to verify that the exit interface is up? 
- `show ip interface brief`
- ~~`show ip protocols`~~
- ~~`show ip route`~~
- ~~`tracert`~~

A static route has been configured on a router. However, the destination network no longer exists. What should an administrator do to remove the static route from the routing table? 
- ~~Change the routing metrix for that route~~
- ~~Nothing. The static route will go away on its own~~
- ~~Change the administrative distance for that route~~
- Remove the route using the `no ip route` command

Which statement describes the sequence of processes executed by a router when it receives a packet from a host to be delivered to a host on another network? 
- ~~It receives the packet and forwards it directly to the destination host~~
- It de-encapsulates the packet, selects the appropriate path, and encapsulates the packet to forward it toward the destination host
- ~~It de-encapsulates the packet and forwards it toward the destination host~~
- ~~It selects the path and forwards it toward the destination host~~

A network engineer issues the `show cdp neighbord` command on several network devices during the process of network documentation. What is the purpose of performing this command?
- To obtain information about directly connected Cisco devices
- ~~To check the networks that are advertised by the neighboring routers~~
- ~~To verify the network addresses that are attached to the network devices~~
- ~~To check the connectivity of PCs that are connected to the network devices~~

A network administrator notices that a correctly entered static route is not in the routing table. What two router commands would an administrator use to determine if the exit interface was up and the next hop address is available? (Choose two.)
- `ping`
- ~~`show ip protocols`~~
- `show ip interface brief`
- ~~`show ip route`~~
- ~~`tracert`~~

A network administrator has entered the following command:  
`ip route 192.168.10.64 255.255.255.192 s0/0/1`  
When the network administrator enters the command `show ip route`, the route is not in the routing table. What should the administrator do next?
- ~~Re-enter the command using the correct mask~~
- Verify that the `s0/0/1` interface is active and available
- ~~Verify that the `192.168.10.64` network is active withing the network infrastructure~~
- ~~Re-enter the command using a network number rather than a usable IP address~~

What will a router do if it does not have a default route configured and a packet needs to be forwarded to a destination network that is not listed in the routing table? 
- ~~Forward it to another router~~
- Drop it
- ~~Send it back to the source~~

What does letter `C` mean next to an entry in the output of the `show ip route` command?
- ~~It identifies a network that is a static route~~
- ~~It identifies a network that is learned through OSFP~~
- ~~It identifies a network that is learned through EIGRP~~
- It identifies a network that is directly connected to the router
